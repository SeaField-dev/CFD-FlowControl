Code repository for: An Exploration of Flow Control Using Machine Learning and Computational Fluid Dynamics

Shape generation program must be run in conjunction with SelfCAD computer aided design software.
Two monitors are required - both with a resolution for 1920x1080, other resolutions are ok but will require new pixel measurements.

Run SelfCAD on the first monitor and the code on the seccond. 
Depending on system RAM shape generation should be done in batches of 1000 - 5000 (1000 on systems with 8GB and 5000 on systems with 64GB+).
